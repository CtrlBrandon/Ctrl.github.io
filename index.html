Six years down the line we’ve grown to an incredible team of over 200, winning multiple awards along the way, and we’re still growing.
We go the extra mile to not just support our customers, but to delight them. We focus on making sure the customer has the best experience possible.
The pride that the Subfero team has for the work we do is shared amongst all team members and we work together to achieve our One Team One Dream vision.</p>

          Our mission is to provide an unrivalled customer experience and we know that this would not be possible without our team of brilliant, knowledgeable, and diverse people. There’s no ‘one size fits all’ approach to working at Subfero and you don’t need to be an IT expert to work for us. You just need to be able to demonstrate experience of delivering excellent customer service, and a passion for all things technology. Your ability to build rapport with our customers is far more important than your technical skills, especially as you will be provided with full training when you start with us.

The program was started to put the ‘WOW’ back into IT support, to not only provide resolutions for technical issues but to give the customer a really positive experience. Our customers are small to medium sized businesses with up to 300 subscriptions. The types of issues we resolve are wide and varied, from billing, subscription, migrations, exchange, and anything in between. No two calls are ever the same, which is what our Ambassadors love about the role. It’s always exciting.</small>

We know it can be challenging for very small businesses to set up their technical environment and we want to offer them a helping hand. During the interactions with these customers, we will talk them through what they are trying to achieve, offer suggestions on the right solutions for them and let them know all about the features and benefits available to them. This is primarily through chat; however, we quickly move to a phone call as we find this is the best way to offer support.</small>
